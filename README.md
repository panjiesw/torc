# TORC - React Toolbox Router Component

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/panjiesw/torc/develop.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/panjiesw/torc) [![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/panjiesw/torc/develop.svg?style=flat-square)](https://codecov.io/gh/panjiesw/torc)

A set of specific compatible components of [React Toolbox](http://www.react-toolbox.com/) with [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) capabilities.

## NOTICE!

**WIP!**

## TODO

- [x] Link component and tests
- [] ButtonLink component and tests
- [] IconButtonLink component and tests
- [] List component (and its subcomponents) and tests
- [] Navigation component

## Limitations

The components code are either copied from or wrapped the React Toolbox original component.
This make the library sort of like a bandaid than a proper solution.
But to make the components here participate in styling and theming procedure of React Toolbox, it's the only way I can think of. Please drop an issue if you find other solutions.
