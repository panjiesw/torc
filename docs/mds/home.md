TORC is a set of [React Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.com) compatible components integrated with [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) capabilities.

The components are either copied from or wrapped the React Toolbox original component.
This make the library sort of like a bandaid than a proper solution.
But to make the components here participate in styling and theming procedure of React Toolbox, it's the only way I can think of.

Below you can find demos and examples of how to use it in an app powered with both React Toolbox and React Router,
like this documentation.
